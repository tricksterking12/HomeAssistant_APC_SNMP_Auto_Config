# HomeAssistant_APC_SNMP_Auto_Config

*Work in progress*

This is planed to allow for quick configuration of old APC Switched PDUs for Home Assistant. The project is currently in a closed development. hopefully the project can be made into a Home Assistant Add-on,  **still in progress**.

Also If you have any sugjestions please share, this is my first big prodect coding in C#.


## Why Not Do It Manually?

The problem I was running it to when typing out the code was that with multible lage PDUs the code becomes messy and its time consuming to add.
